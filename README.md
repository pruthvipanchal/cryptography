# Cryptography
Codes and outputs for the encryption and decryption of some popular ciphers.<br>

1. Playfair cipher - It is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digram substitution cipher. Contains the encryption as well as decryption codes with their outputs.<br>
2. Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem - It is a public key cryptosystem, meaning that two keys are used, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is based on the subset sum problem. Contains the encryption code as well as its output.
